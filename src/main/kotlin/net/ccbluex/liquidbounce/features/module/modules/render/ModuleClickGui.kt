 * ---
 * MODIFIED from the stock file to open the native GuiGraphics-rendered
 * NativeClickGuiScreen (render/clickgui/) instead of the web/Ultralight
 * CustomSharedMinecraftScreen / CustomStandaloneMinecraftScreen. Diff
 * summary against the original, so this is auditable rather than a
 * silent rewrite:
 *
 *   - onEnabled() now does `mc.gui.setScreen(NativeClickGuiScreen())`
 *     instead of opening a CustomSharedMinecraftScreen/
 *     CustomStandaloneMinecraftScreen(CustomScreenType.CLICK_GUI).
 *   - `scale`, `searchBarAutoFocus`, and Snapping's `gridSize` lost their
 *     `private` modifier - NativeClickGuiScreen/NativePanel read them
 *     directly instead of this module needing to push the values out via
 *     events (ClickGuiScaleChangeEvent/ClickGuiValueChangeEvent are still
 *     fired on change, in case other code listens for them, but nothing
 *     here still *needs* them fired to function).
 *   - The `Cache` setting, `standaloneScreen` field,
 *     `updateStandaloneScreen()`, and the `browserReadyHandler` /
 *     `tickHandler` handlers are REMOVED: all of that machinery exists to
 *     manage a persistent embedded-browser instance's lifecycle (whether
 *     to cache it, syncing it after a world change, toggling its
 *     visibility every tick). A plain Screen has no such instance -
 *     Minecraft already constructs/discards it for free - so keeping that
 *     code would be dead weight that references a browser this screen
 *     doesn't have. If you still use the web GUI elsewhere and want both
 *     available side by side, don't drop this file in as a full
 *     replacement - restore the browser-lifecycle members from your
 *     original copy instead.
 *   - isInSearchBar now checks NativeClickGuiScreen.isSearchFocused()
 *     instead of the two Custom*MinecraftScreen classes' text-focus state.
